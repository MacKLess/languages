      <h1>Coding Language Quiz</h1>
      <div class="page1">
        <h3>Find the right coding language for you!</h3>
        <p>
          Picking a coding language is much like adopting a new kitten: there are lots of options and <strong>no</strong> real wrong answers. The purpose of this quiz is to help you narrow down a suggested language based on your preferences and eventually what you'd like to do with your new-found skills. Once you've learned one language, you should be able to learn more as your interests grow. <em>(Not so much the case with kittens, unless your career aspirations include becoming a cat-lady/-gent.)</em> Enjoy!

          What's your poison <em>(or rather, what's your code)</em>? Do you prefer to work behind the scenes with business code or is your passion for front-end, user specific code?

        <p>Where would you like to work? There are all kinds of businesses out there who employ developers and they come in different sizes. Some people like working for large companies, which often have great benefits and numerous roles and teams to explore and transition between/within. Others prefer smaller companies which can have more of a sense of community and often offer the opportunity to wear more than one "hat" when it comes to work projects. Which appeals more to you?</p>
