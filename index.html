      <div class="page page1">
        <h3>Find the right coding language for you!</h3>
        <p>
          Picking a coding language is much like adopting a new kitten: there are lots of options and <strong>no</strong> real wrong answers. The purpose of this quiz is to help you narrow down a suggested language based on:
          <ol>
            <li>what general type of code you like;</li>
            <li>what skills you are interested in learning; and</li>
            <li>where you would, ideally, like to work.</li>
          </ol>
          Once you've learned one language, you should be able to learn more as your interests grow. <em>(Collecting kittens is less recommended, unless your career aspirations include becoming a cat-lady/-gent. We're not judging.)</em> Enjoy!

          <ul>
          There are many programming languages out there. This quiz is going to focus on the following:
          </ul>
          <li>CSS and Design</li>
          <li>C#</li>
          <li>Java</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>PHP</li>
          How many languages do you want to learn?
        </p>
        <label><input type="radio" name="trick" value="few">  I would like to focus on one or two and really build my comprehension.</label>
        <label><input type="radio" name="trick" value="all">  I want to learn them all. Load me up, man! I'm here to learn!</label>
        <button type="button" class="pagetrickbtn">Next!</button>

        <p>
          So that was a trick question. We can't teach you <strong>all</strong> the programming languages in one go. We can help you learn one or two. Once you've got those under your belt, you should be able to pick up other languages with more ease. You'll probably learn several languages over the course of your career. What this quiz is intended to do is give you an idea where to start.</p>
          <br><h3>Now for the real test:</h3>
          <p>What's your poison <em>(or rather, what's your code)</em>? Do you prefer to work behind the scenes with business (aka "back-end") code or is your passion for front-end, user specific code?
        </p>
        <label><input type="radio" name="position" value="front">  I like the spotlight! Put me front and center.</label>
        <label><input type="radio" name="position" value="back">  Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. I prefer back-end code.</label>
        <button type="button" class="page2btn">Next!</button>

        <p>SQL (<strong>S</strong>tructured <strong>Q</strong>uery <strong>L</strong>anguage) is the language you use to interact with a database. Considered a very valuable skillset, learning SQL can make a developer more competitive in the field; however, studying it now may not be the best choice for your current plans. Other systems such as KISSmetrics can fill the role of SQL in many situations and if you don't have a strong background in Google Analytics and Excel, learning SQL might be more difficult. So, is SQL a <em>must<em> for your current career plans?</p>
        <label><input type="radio" name="SQL" value="yes">  Yes! I will pillage databases like a well-dressed viking on the company dime!</label>
        <label><input type="radio" name="SQL" value="no">  Nah. I'll save that rabbithole for another time.</label>

        <p>Where would you like to work? There are all kinds of businesses out there who employ developers and they come in different sizes. Some people like working for large companies, which often have great benefits and numerous roles and teams to explore and transition between/within. Others prefer smaller companies which can have more of a sense of community and often offer the opportunity to wear more than one "hat" when it comes to work projects. Which appeals more to you?</p>
        <label><input type="radio" name="company" value="big">  I want to join the Borg! Go big or go home!</label>
        <label><input type="radio" name="company" value="small">  I'm a small town kinda gal/guy. I prefer to know all my coworkers.</label>

        <p>So, you're interested in working for a larger scale company. <span class="underline">We've got to ask</span>, is a blue badge from Microsoft what you're dreaming of? It's a major player in the industry and has a lot of perks, especially in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
        <label><input type="radio" name="microsoft" value="pro">  I want a blue badge of my very own for my birthday!</label>
